Project Summary:
To complete this task, I developed a full-stack sample user management application using ASP.NET Core for the backend API and Angular 18 (using NgModules, not standalone) for the frontend UI. The backend was designed to return mock user data via a RESTful API with CORS configured to allow requests from the Angular development server. The Angular application includes a navigation menu, a list view to display users, and a form to create or edit individual users. I used modular architecture with dedicated services and components following best practices such as separation of concerns and reactive programming with RxJS. Styling was handled using custom CSS to provide a clean, responsive UI. If I were to improve anything, I would add proper form validation, persistent database integration (e.g., with EF Core), and token-based authentication for secure API access.

Tools Used:

Angular 18

ASP.NET Core 8

Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio 2022

Postman (for API testing)

Google Chrome DevTools

RxJS

TypeScript



step 1 : Extract the project to a local folder.

Step 2: Run the .NET API Backend
Step 3: Run the Angular Frontend

if the api is running with http://localhost:55547/api/user , check the smae is configured in usersevice base url aswell.(adjust based on your launchSettings.json)
